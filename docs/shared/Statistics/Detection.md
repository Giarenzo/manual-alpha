The Statistics section provides tools for analyzing detection data to understand bird activity patterns, assess risks, and improve area safety. 
This page allows you to gain statistical insights thanks to the log of all events recorded by the system over the selected timeframe. User may then make data-informed decisions on this basis.

# Menu

- In the top left corner you will see a download icon. This allows you to extract an xlsx file containing all data related to the chosen are and timeframe.
- In the top right corner, a pop-up menu will appear once you click on the calendar icon. This allows you to select a timeframe for which you want to see data. All displayed entries will refer to that timeframe.
- Should you have several areas in which the system is installed, you may select the one you want to display data for via an additional drop-down menu.
- In the row below, you will be able to select how you view the collected data according to 5 criteria: time, sector, sector heatmap, year comparison, flying direction

# Time Tab

- This tab show data broken down by hour, day, week or month. You can select how to view it (e.g. hourly) by clicking a button in the top-right corner, within the tab frame.
- Additional filters (e.g. species breakdown, different chart types) may be available within the tab.
    - **Species Breakdown**: View a breakdown of detected bird species over the selected time period. This data helps identify which species are most commonly detected and may pose a higher risk.
    - **Pie Charts and Graphs**: The system displays species distribution using pie charts and bar graphs for easy visualization and comparison.
    - **Species Filter**: Use the species filter to focus on specific bird species. This helps in analyzing the activity patterns and risks associated with particular species.
- The tab frame is divided in two:
    - In the top part, you will find charts on the selected data, broken down by the selected timeframe (e.g. week or month)
    - In the bottom part, you will find numerical values of the detections, also broken down by the selected timeframe and by species, when available. The amounts display automatically a breakdown of flying / standing specimens. For example: 8/3 (11) indicates that 8 birds flying and 3 sitting, for a total of 11, were detected and counted for that species in that timeframe.
- This data helps identify which species are most commonly detected and may pose a higher risk

# Sector Tab

- This tab show data broken down by sector.
- The tab frame is divided in two:
    - In the top part, you will find charts on the selected data in a bar chart with the horizontal axis indicating the different sectors and the vertical axis indicating the amount of detections.
    - In the bottom part, you will find numerical values of the detections, also broken down by the selected sector and by species, when available. The amounts display automatically a breakdown of flying / standing specimens. For example: 8/3 (11) indicates that 8 birds flying and 3 sitting, for a total of 11, were detected and counted for that species in that sector.

# Sector Heatmap Tab

- This tab show data broken down by sector.
- The tab frame is divided in two:
    - In the top part you will see two maps:
        - In the map on the left, you will find a heatmap showing the number of detections in each sector
        - In the map on the right, you will find a heatmap showing the average local risk index in each sector
    - In the bottom part, you will find the same information as displayed in the two maps in table form.
        - Note: Total Tracks / Total Events is the same as saying Total Detections / Total Events

# Year Comparison Tab

- This tab show data broken down by year.
- The tab frame is divided in two:
    - In the top part, you will find charts on the selected data in a bar chart with the horizontal axis indicating the different months, colour-coded by year to allow quick comparisons, and the vertical axis indicating the amount of detections.
- In the bottom part, you will find numerical values of the detections, also broken down by month and year. Only the total number of detections is displayed.

# Flying Direction Tab

This tab allows you to graphically see the direction of all detected specimens in the chosen time bracket.
