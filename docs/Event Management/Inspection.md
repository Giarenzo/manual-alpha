## Site inspection

The site inspection tab allows a user to log a physical visit to a sector via a standard form. If a physical visit to a sector is requested, this should be logged here.

- The orange plus icon in the top left-corner opens an input form. The form allows for manual input of all relevant data. Once saved, data from each saved form will appear as a single entry in the log table.
- In the top-right corner, the two-arrow icon resets table filters to their default value, whereas the grid icon allows you to select the columns you would like to be displayed in the log.
- Once the log is displayed, you can use the first row of the table to order, search and filter results according to the available options

## Bird Observation Survey

The bird observation survey tab allows a user to log a remote visit to a sector via a camera’s PTZ function. If a remote check on a sector is needed or is requested, this should be logged here.

- The orange plus icon in the top left-corner opens an input form. The form allows for manual input of all relevant data. Once saved, data from each saved form will appear as a single entry in the log table.

- Once the log is displayed, you can use the first row of the table to order, search and filter results according to the available options

## Mortality Search

This tab allows a user to log a mortality search, basically a check for birds trapped in mud or sands. If a mortality search is needed or is requested, this should be logged here.
