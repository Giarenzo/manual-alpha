## The Top Bar

- In the top-right corner, the two-arrow icon resets table filters to their default value, whereas the grid icon allows you to select the columns you would like to be displayed in the list.
- Once the list is displayed, you can use the first row of the table to order, search and filter results according to the available options.

## The User List

- **Description**: a free-text description of the service 
- **No. of panels**: this is a legacy option, it serves no practical purpose.
